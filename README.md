## System requirements

The codes were developed and tested with MATLAB R2019a on Windows Server 2012.

Some of the codes have dependency on a shared library: https://github.com/optobrain/matlab-lib

No non-standard hardware is required.

## Installation guide

No installation is required, except for MATLAB R2019a or higher.

Typical install time for MATLAB R2019a is less than an hour.

## Demo / Instructions for use

The main codes of each folder are written in live scripts which include step-by-step instructions and are self-explanatory.

When run with the data (linked in the manuscript), the codes are expected to produce the figures of time courses and LME analysis presented in the manuscript.

The run time is expected to be less than several minutes for each figure.
